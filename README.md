# mma7455-spin 
--------------

This is a P8X32A/Propeller driver object for the NXP MMA7455 3DoF accelerometer

**IMPORTANT**: This software is meant to be used with the [spin-standard-library](https://github.com/avsa242/spin-standard-library) (P8X32A) or [p2-spin-standard-library](https://github.com/avsa242/p2-spin-standard-library) (P2X8C4M64P). Please install the applicable library first before attempting to use this code, otherwise you will be missing several files required to build the project.

## Salient Features

* I2C connection at up to 400kHz
* Alternate I2C address support (NOTE: This is device-dependent, and must have been factory programmed to function)
* Read raw accelerometer data, or data in micro-g's
* Change operating mode (standby, measure, level detection, pulse detection)
* Data ready and overrun flags
* Perform calibration and store results in on-chip (volatile) offset registers
* Interrupts: set threshold, read flags, clear INT1/INT2 state

## Requirements

P1/SPIN1:
* spin-standard-library
* P1/SPIN1: 1 extra core/cog for the PASM I2C engine
* sensor.imu.common.spinh (provided by spin-standard-library)

P2/SPIN2:
* p2-spin-standard-library
* sensor.imu.common.spin2h (provided by p2-spin-standard-library)

## Limitations

* Alternate I2C address functionality must have been programmed by the manufacturer in order to function (HW limitation)
